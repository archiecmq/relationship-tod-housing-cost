## Abstract

Transit-oriented development (TOD) has gained popularity as a means of redressing a series of urban problems. TOD has, however, also been criticized for potentially posing risks for neighborhood equity and affordability. In order to research the validity of these concerns, the author utilizes a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis that investigates whether and the extent to which the presence of Light Rail Transit (LRT) station areas, especially those in the core city of a county, is associated with housing cost burdens. 

The analysis is conducted for the neighborhood change between 2000 and 2010 in 2 countiesâ€”Multnomah County and Los Angeles County that built light rail transit systems since the 1980s. Results show no statistically significant evidence of more housing cost burdens around LRT station areas in both counties, even for those that are located in their core central cities, Portland and Los Angeles respectively. Hence, the study confirms the positive benefits of transit-oriented developments without more risks posing danger to equity and affordability. 

On the other hand, the author recognizes the limitations of the MLR analysis and recommends alternative modeling methods such as the spatial autoregressive model for future research on this topic. The author also emphasizes the necessity of taking into consideration the effect of other unobserved factors. One of the major unobserved factors the author mentions is policies that promote affordable housing. The author believes if connecting with adequate affordable housing policies, equity can be further ensured in neighborhoods under transit-oriented developments.
